# **ALX -Software Engineering  PROJECT**
## **AIRBNB CLONE**

# *Description*
This  is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interface in a clone of AirBnB.

This team project is part of the (Alx) Software Engineering program,but unforunaltly i did it alone. it is pretty exahusting at first knowing that ,doing all thing alone ,seeing the result is rewarding
It represents the first step towards building a full web application.

This first step consists of:
- a custom command-line interface for data management,
- and the base classes for the storage of this data.

# *Usage*

|  *Command*         |    *Examples*                             |

|Create an object    |(hbnb) create <class>                      | 
|Show an object      |(hbnb) show <class> <id>                   |
|Destroy an object   |(hbnb) destroy <class> <id>                |

and more.
